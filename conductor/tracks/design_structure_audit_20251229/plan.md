# Plan - Project Structure and Design Audit

## Phase 1: Preparation & Information Gathering
- [x] Task: Review `conductor/` and `_codex/` for canonical project structure and architectural definitions. [docs]
- [x] Task: Scan `backend/` directory to map current implementation of routers, database modules, and utilities. [scan]
- [ ] Task: Scan `web/model_manager_frontend/` to map current implementation of components, state, and API layers.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Preparation & Information Gathering' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Cross-Analysis & Identification
- [ ] Task: Compare `backend/` structure against the "Backend APIs" and "Design" docs in `_codex/` and `conductor/tech-stack.md`.
- [ ] Task: Compare `web/model_manager_frontend/` structure and state management against `conductor/tech-stack.md` and product goals.
- [ ] Task: Identify discrepancies in naming conventions, file placement, and architectural layering.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Cross-Analysis & Identification' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Reporting & Recommendation
- [ ] Task: Draft the discrepancy report `<date-h24:mm>-discrepancies.md` detailing findings, impacts, and advice.
- [ ] Task: Review report for clarity and actionable recommendations.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Reporting & Recommendation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
