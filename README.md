# Hikaze Model Manager 2

Hikaze Model Manager 2 is a ComfyUI extension that provides a dedicated model manager and node-integrated selectors for checkpoints and LoRAs.

## What you can do
- Browse model libraries with search, tag filters, and card or list views.
- Inspect model details with preview images, tags, prompts, and descriptions.
- Open the manager from nodes to select a checkpoint or a LoRA list and write the selection back to the node.
- Review pending imports and migrate models into the active library.
- Keep sensitive content out of the default view with safety-first filtering.

## Where it appears
- In ComfyUI nodes: Checkpoint Loader and LoRA Power Loader open the manager in context.
- As a standalone manager page for full-screen browsing.
